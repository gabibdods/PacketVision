# F1 24 UDP | Library for use on ESP 32 / ESP8266 devices
**Data Output from F1® 24 Game**

> Note from developer: I do not have F1 24 and therefore am unable to test the library, it is based on [f1-23-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1-23-udp) with the updated UDP documentation. Please create an issue if it does not work and I will fix it ASAP.

This program captures and parses packets that are sent by the F1 2024 game. This library is written specifically for usage on the ESP32 and ESP8266.

# Usage:
```C
#include "F1_24_UDP.h"
F1_24_Parser* parser;

void setup()
{
    parser->begin();
}

void loop()
{
    parser = new F1_24_Parser();
    parser->read()
}

```

## Overview

The F1 series of games support the output of certain game data across UDP connections. This data can be used supply race information to external applications, or to drive certain hardware (e.g. motion platforms, force feedback steering wheels and LED devices).

The following information summarise these data structures so that developers of supporting hardware or software can configure these to work correctly with the F1 game. 

> Note: To ensure that you are using the latest specification for this game, please check the official forum page [here](https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/F1-24-UDP-Specification/td-p/13745220). 
 
## Packet Information


### Packet Types

Each packet can now carry different types of data rather than having one packet which contains everything. A header has been added to each packet as well so that versioning can be tracked and it will be easier for applications to check they are interpreting the incoming data in the correct way. Please note that all values are encoded using Little Endian format. All data is packed.

The following data types are used in the structures:

| Type   | Description             |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| uint8  | Unsigned 8-bit integer  |
| int8   | Signed 8-bit integer    |
| uint16 | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
| int16  | Signed 16-bit integer   |
| uint32 | Unsigned 32-bit integer |
| float  | Floating point (32-bit) |
| uint64 | Unsigned 64-bit integer |

### Packet Header

Each packet has the following header:

Size: 29 bytes

```c#
struct PacketHeader
{
uint16 m_packetFormat; // 2024
uint8 m_gameYear; // Game year - last two digits e.g. 24
uint8 m_gameMajorVersion; // Game major version - "X.00"
uint8 m_gameMinorVersion; // Game minor version - "1.XX"
uint8 m_packetVersion; // Version of this packet type, all start from 1
uint8 m_packetId; // Identifier for the packet type, see below
uint64 m_sessionUID; // Unique identifier for the session
float m_sessionTime; // Session timestamp
uint32 m_frameIdentifier; // Identifier for the frame the data was retrieved on
uint32 m_overallFrameIdentifier; // Overall identifier for the frame the data was retrieved
// on, doesn't go back after flashbacks
uint8 m_playerCarIndex; // Index of player's car in the array
uint8 m_secondaryPlayerCarIndex; // Index of secondary player's car in the array (splitscreen)
// 255 if no second player
};
```

## **Packet IDs**

The packets IDs are as follows:

|**Packet Name**|**Value**|**Description**|
| - | - | - |
|Motion|0|Contains all motion data for player’s car – only sent while player is in control|
|Session|1|Data about the session – track, time left|
|Lap Data|2|Data about all the lap times of cars in the session|
|Event|3|Various notable events that happen during a session|
|Participants|4|List of participants in the session, mostly relevant for multiplayer|
|Car Setups|5|Packet detailing car setups for cars in the race|
|Car Telemetry|6|Telemetry data for all cars|
|Car Status|7|Status data for all cars|
|Final Classification|8|Final classification confirmation at the end of a race|
|Lobby Info|9|Information about players in a multiplayer lobby|
|Car Damage|10|Damage status for all cars|
|Session History|11|Lap and tyre data for session|
|Tyre Sets|12|Extended tyre set data|
|Motion Ex|13|Extended motion data for player car|
|Time Trial|14|Time Trial Specific Data|

## **Motion Packet**

The motion packet gives physics data for all the cars being driven.

*N.B. For the normalised vectors below, to convert to float values divide by 32767.0f – 16-bit signed values are used to pack the data and on the assumption that direction values are always between -1.0f and 1.0f.*

## **Session History Packet**

This packet contains lap times and tyre usage for the session. **This packet works slightly differently to other packets. To reduce CPU and bandwidth, each packet relates to a specific vehicle and is sent every 1/20 s, and the vehicle being sent is cycled through. Therefore in a 20 car race you should receive an update for each vehicle at least once per second.**

Note that at the end of the race, after the final classification packet has been sent, a final bulk update of all the session histories for the vehicles in that session will be sent.

## **Restricted data (Your Telemetry setting)**

There is some data in the UDP that you may not want other players seeing if you are in a multiplayer game. This is controlled by the “Your Telemetry” setting in the Telemetry options. The options are:

- Restricted (Default) – other players viewing the UDP data will not see values for your car
- Public – all other players can see all the data for your car
- Show online ID – this additional option allows other players to view your online ID / gamertag in their UDP output.

Note: You can always see the data for the car you are driving regardless of the setting.

The following data items are set to zero if the player driving the car in question has their “Your Telemetry” set to “Restricted”:

### ***Car status packet***

- m_fuelInTank
- m_fuelCapacity
- m_fuelMix
- m_fuelRemainingLaps
- m_frontBrakeBias
- m_ersDeployMode

- m_engineCEWear
- m_engineICEWear
- m_engineMGUKWear
- m_engineTCWear

### ***Tyre set packet***
- All data within this packet for player car

To allow other players to view your online ID in their UDP output during an online session, you must enable the “Show online ID / gamertags” option. Selecting this will bring up a confirmation box that must be confirmed before this option is enabled. 

Please note that all options can be changed during a game session and will take immediate effect.


#**FAQS**

## **How do I enable the UDP Telemetry Output?**
In F1 23, UDP telemetry output is controlled via the in-game menus. To enable this, enter the options menu from the main menu (triangle / Y), then enter the settings menu - the UDP option will be at the bottom of the list. From there you will be able to enable / disable the UDP output, configure the IP address and port for the receiving application, toggle broadcast mode and set the send rate. Broadcast mode transmits the data across the network subnet to allow multiple devices on the same subnet to be able to receive this information. When using broadcast mode it is not necessary to set a target IP address, just a target port for applications to listen on.

*Advanced PC Users*: You can additionally edit the game’s configuration XML file to configure UDP output. The file is located here (after an initial boot of the game):

...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml

You should see the tag:

<motion>

...

  <udp enabled="false" broadcast=”false” ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" sendRate=”20” format=”2024” yourTelemetry=”restricted” onlineNames="off" />

...


</motion>

Here you can set the values manually. Note that any changes made within the game when it is running will overwrite any changes made manually. Note the enabled flag is now a state.


## **What has changed since last year?**
F1® 24 sees the following changes to the UDP specification:

- Adding simulation/rules options to the session packet
- Event type added to show details of safety car events
- Show online names and Your Telemetry settings added to online lobby packet
- F1 World Tech level added to lobby and participants packets
- Added minute part to car in front and leader’s deltas in lap packet
- Renamed MS and Minute items to include the word part to make it clearer
- Changed formula list received in session packet
- Final Classification packets now get sent every five seconds on the results screen in case they were missed initially
- Added Time Trial packet to give more specialised information when in that game mode
- Added plank height data to the Motion Ex packet
- Added suspension roll angle to the Motion Ex packet
- Inter-car collision event added
- Weekend structure added to session packet
- Increased the size of the weather forecast array from 56 to 64 in order to accommodate new sprint weekends with more sessions
- Added speed trap details to lap packet for all cars in case any speed trap events are missed
- Added chassis yaw to Motion Ex packet to be able to work out amount of slide
- Added engine braking parameter to car setups packet
- Added track sector 2 & 3 distances to session data so marshal zone matching is easier
- Added front wing value at next pit stop to car setup for players


## **What is the order of the wheel arrays?**
All wheel arrays are in the following order:

   0 – Rear Left (RL)

   1 – Rear Right (RR)

   2 – Front Left (FL)

   3 – Front Right (FR)


## **Do the vehicle indices change?**
During a session, each car is assigned a vehicle index. This will not change throughout the session and all the arrays that are sent use this vehicle index to dereference the correct piece of data.

## **What are the co-ordinate systems used?**
Here is a visual representation of the co-ordinate system used with the F1 telemetry data.

![Example of co-ord system around silverstone](co-ord_system_silverstone.png)

![Co-ord system diagram](co-ord_system_diagram.png)

## **What encoding format is used?**
All values are encoded using Little Endian format.


## **Are the data structures packed?**
Yes, all data is packed, there is no padding used.


## **How many cars are in the data structures?**
The maximum number of cars in the data structures is 22, to allow for certain game modes, although the data is not always filled in.

You should always check the data item called m_numActiveCars in the participants packet which tells you how many cars are active in the race. However, you should check the individual result status of each car in the lap data to see if that car is actively providing data. If it is not “Invalid” or “Inactive” then the corresponding vehicle index has valid data.


## **How often are updated packets sent?**
For the packets which get updated at “Rate as specified in the menus” you can be guaranteed that on the frame that these get sent they will all get sent together and will never be separated across frames. This of course relies on the reliability of your network as to whether they are received correctly as everything is sent via UDP. Other packets that get sent at specific rates can arrive on any frame.

If you are connected to the game when it starts transmitting the first frame will contain the following information to help initialise data structures on the receiving application:

**Packets sent on Frame 1: (All packets sent on this frame have “Session timestamp” 0.000)**

- Session
- Participants
- Car Setups
- Lap Data
- Motion Data
- Car Telemetry 
- Car Status
- Car Damage
- Motion Ex Data

As an example, assuming that you are running at 60Hz with 60Hz update rate selected in the menus then you would expect to see the following packets and timestamps:

**Packets sent on Frame 2: (All packets sent on this frame have “Session timestamp” 0.016)**

- Lap Data
- Motion Data
- Car Telemetry
- Car Status
- Motion Ex Data

…

**Packets sent on Frame 31: (All packets sent on this frame have “Session timestamp” 0.5)**

- Session (since 2 updates per second)
- Car Setups (since 2 updates per second)
- Lap Data
- Motion Data
- Car Telemetry
- Car Status
- Car Damage (since 2 updates per second)
- Motion Ex Data

## **Will my old app still work with F1 23?**
**Please note that from F1 24 the game will only support the previous 2 UDP formats.**

F1 24 uses a new format for the UDP data. However, some earlier formats of the data are still supported so that most older apps implemented using the previous data formats should work with little or no change from the developer. To use the old formats, please enter the UDP options menu and set “UDP Format” to either “2023” or “2022”. 

Specifications for the older formats can be seen here:

- F1 23 - `https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/F1-23-UDP-telemetry-documentation/m-p/12632769`
- F1 22 - `https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/F1-22-UDP-Specification/td-p/11551274`

## **How do I enable D-BOX output?**
D-BOX output is currently supported on the PC platform. In F1 23, the D-BOX activation can be controlled via the menus. Navigate to Game Options->Settings->UDP Telemetry Settings->D-BOX to activate this on your system.

*Advanced PC Users:* It is possible to control D-BOX by editing the games’ configuration XML file. The file is located here (after an initial boot of the game):

...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml

You should see the tag:

  <motion>
...
      
    <dbox enabled="false" />

...

  </motion>

Set the “enabled” value to “true” to allow the game to output to your D-BOX motion platform. Note that any changes made within the game when it is running will overwrite any changes made manually.


## **How can I disable in-game support for LED device?**
The F1 game has native support for some of the basic features supported by some external LED devices, such as the *Leo Bodnar SLI Pro* and the *Fanatec* steering wheels. To avoid conflicts between the game’s implementation and any third-party device managers on the PC platform it may be necessary to disable the native support. This is done using the following led_display flags in the hardware_settings_config.xml. The file is located here (after an initial boot of the game):

...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml

The flags to enabled/disable LED output are:

<led_display fanatecNativeSupport="true" sliProNativeSupport="true" />

The sliProNativeSupport flag controls the output to SLI Pro devices. The fanatecNativeSupport flag controls the output to Fanatec (and some related) steering wheel LEDs. Set the values for any of these to “false” to disable them and avoid conflicts with your own device manager.

Please note there is an additional flag to manually control the LED brightness on the SLI Pro:

<led_display sliProForceBrightness="127" />

This option (using value in the range 0-255) will be ignored when setting the sliProNativeSupport flag to “false”.
##
Also note it is now possible to edit these values on the fly via the Game Options->Settings->UDP Telemetry Settings menu.


## **Can I configure the UDP output using an XML File?**
PC users can edit the game’s configuration XML file to configure UDP output. The file is located here (after an initial boot of the game):

...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml

You should see the tag:

   <motion>

...

     <udp enabled="false" broadcast=”false” ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" sendRate=”20” format=”2024” yourTelemetry="restricted" onlineNames="off" />

...

   </motion>

Here you can set the values manually. Note that any changes made within the game when it is running will overwrite any changes made manually.
